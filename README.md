# Calulation-of-M-polynomial-and-topological-indices-
To simplify calculations and data analysis, a computer-based computing technique and algorithm are utilized. Here are the steps:
1. Draw a graph of G on a newGraph and calculate its adjacency matrix A.
2. Utilize our MATLAB program to input matrix A and carry out the necessary computations.
